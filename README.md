📊 AtliQ Hardware (Power BI Data Analytics Project)
Project Overview

AtliQ Hardware is a fast-growing global company selling computers and accessories. To move away from intuition- and Excel-based decisions—which previously led to losses, especially in the American market—the company adopted Power BI–driven analytics.
This project delivers an end-to-end Power BI dashboard providing insights across Finance, Sales, Marketing, Supply Chain, and Executive management, enabling data-driven decision-making and competitive advantage.
